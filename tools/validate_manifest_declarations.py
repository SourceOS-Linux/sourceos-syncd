"""Every declaration in .sourceos/manifest.json must correspond to something real.

The manifest declares `policyClasses`, `auditEvents` and `dangerousSurfaces`. Nothing
read the file, and — checked for the first time here — not one of the declarations
appears anywhere in the source. The audit events it promises are emitted by no code;
the dangerous surfaces it names are referenced by no gate. A reader encountering the
manifest would reasonably conclude this daemon emits four audit events. It emits none.

Making that fail outright would put the build red on arrival, which is how a check
gets disabled rather than satisfied. So this is a RATCHET: the existing gap is named,
dated and counted where it cannot be overlooked, and any declaration added from now on
must be real or the build fails. Debt shrinks or holds; it does not grow quietly.

Remove entries from KNOWN_UNIMPLEMENTED as each is genuinely emitted. When the set is
empty, delete it and the check becomes a plain assertion.
