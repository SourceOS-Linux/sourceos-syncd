"""Every declaration in .sourceos/manifest.json must correspond to something real.

The manifest declares policyClasses, auditEvents and dangerousSurfaces. Nothing read
the file, and not one of the declarations appears anywhere in the source. The audit
events it promises are emitted by no code; the dangerous surfaces it names are
referenced by no gate. A reader encountering the manifest would reasonably conclude
this daemon emits four audit events. It emits none.

Making that fail outright would put the build red on arrival, which is how a check gets
disabled rather than satisfied. So this is a RATCHET: the existing gap is named, dated
and counted where it cannot be overlooked, and any declaration added from now on must be
real or the build fails. Debt shrinks or holds; it does not grow quietly.

The allowlist is checked in BOTH directions — an entry the manifest no longer declares,
and an entry that has since been implemented — because a list that outlives its debt
silently re-permits the next regression.
